      <h1>PASSPORTS & OTHER DOCUMENTS</h1>
      <p>The Glasgow consulate does not issue passports. Passports are issued either in Sweden or by the <a href="https://www.swedenabroad.se/en/about-abroad-for-swedish-citizens/united-kingdom/service-to-swedish-citizens/passport-abroad/" target="_blank" class="external-link external-link-size">SWEDISH EMBASSY IN LONDON</a> where the applicant will have to attend in person. It can be difficult to get a booking but new appointments are released regularly.</p>
      <p>When your application has been approved you can request that your passport is delivered to the consulate here in Glasgow. Similarly, you can have a newly-issued ID card or driving licence delivered here. There is a fee for these services. We will require photographic identification before releasing documents.</p>
      <h2 class="passports-padding-top">VISAS</h2>
      <p>All visa applications must be made to <a href="https://www.vfsglobal.se/UK/index.html" target="_blank" class="external-link external-link-size">VFS IN EDINBURGH</a> or to the <a href="https://www.swedenabroad.se/en/about-abroad-for-swedish-citizens/united-kingdom/service-to-swedish-citizens/passport-abroad/" target="_blank" class="external-link external-link-size">SWEDISH EMBASSY IN LONDON</a>. </p>

      <p>The Glasgow consulate can issue emergency passports subject to approval from the Embassy.</p>
      <p>Please note: if you need an emergency passport because your normal passport has been lost or stolen then you must obtain a report from the relevant police force to submit with your application.</p>
