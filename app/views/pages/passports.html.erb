      <h1>PASSPORTS & OTHER DOCUMENTS</h1>
      <p>The Glasgow consulate does not issue passports but can assist with applications. Passports will be issued either in Sweden or by the Swedish Embassy in London where the applicant will have to attend in person.</p>
      <p>You can call the embassy on 0207 917 6400.</p>
      <p>When your application has been approved you can request that your passport is delivered to the consulate here in Glasgow. Similarly, you can have a newly-issued ID card or driving licence delivered here. Our fee for this service is £12 and we will require photographic identification before releasing documents.</p>
      <p>All visa applications must be made to vfs in Edinburgh or to the Swedish Embassy in London. In certain circumstances they will allow these to be processed in Glasgow.</p>
      <h2>EMERGENCY PASSPORTS</h2>
      <p>The Glasgow consulate can issue emergency passports.</p>
      <p>Please note: if you need an emergency passport because your normal passport has been lost or stolen then you must obtain a report from the relevant police force to submit with your application. Contact us for advice.</p>
